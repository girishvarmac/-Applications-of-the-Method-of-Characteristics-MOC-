# Applications of Method of Characteristics (MOC)

## üìå Project Overview
This project explored the **Method of Characteristics (MOC)** for the design and analysis of supersonic nozzles.  
The work combined analytical MOC formulations, MATLAB coding, and CFD simulations to evaluate nozzle performance, flow smoothness, and design efficiency.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methods
- **MOC Implementation**  
  - Applied the **Method of Characteristics (MOC)** to design 2D axisymmetric supersonic nozzles (target Mach 3).  
  - Developed MATLAB scripts for characteristic line intersections and compatibility equations.  

- **MATLAB Routines**  
  - Automated nozzle contour generation.  
  - Implemented compatibility conditions to handle boundary reflections and smooth flow transitions.  

- **CFD Validation**  
  - Conducted ANSYS Fluent simulations of MOC-generated nozzle profiles.  
  - Compared **minimum-length vs. gradual-expansion nozzle designs**.  
  - Analyzed Mach number distribution, shock-free expansion, and wall pressure profiles.  

## üìä Results
- **Minimum-length nozzles**: compact designs but prone to higher flow divergence.  
- **Gradual-expansion nozzles**: smoother flow transitions and reduced flow separation.  
- CFD validated MOC predictions with strong agreement in Mach distribution.  
- Demonstrated the **broader applications of MOC** for aerospace propulsion system design.
